Feature: Readings
  As someone who works at a project's site
  I want to fill in the published reading forms on a visit
  So that what we measured is recorded the same way every time, with the visit it came from (ADR-0008)

  Background:
    Given I am signed in with an existing account
    And I have a customer "Acme Ltd" with status "Active" and tags "retail"
    And "Acme Ltd" has a site "Haifa warehouse"
    And I have a project named "Panel upgrade" at the site "Haifa warehouse"
    And "Panel upgrade" has a visit 2 days ago with the notes "Panel delivered"
    # Reading forms are built and published through task 060's pages, as an admin of my workspace.
    And I have a published reading form "Panel check" with the fields:
      | label           | type   | unit | required | options             |
      | Voltage         | Number | V    | yes      |                     |
      | Breaker trips   | Yes/no |      | no       |                     |
      | Cable condition | Choice |      | no       | Good, Worn, Damaged |
      | Remarks         | Text   |      | no       |                     |

  @wip @task:061
  Scenario: I fill in a reading on a visit
    When I open the visit "Panel delivered" of "Panel upgrade"
    And I follow the "Add a reading" link
    And I follow the "Panel check" link
    And I fill in "Voltage" with "230"
    And I choose "Yes" for "Breaker trips"
    And I select "Worn" from "Cable condition"
    And I press "Save reading"
    Then I see the heading "Panel check"
    And I see the text "230 V"
    And I see the text "Worn"
    And I see the text "Not filled in"
    And I see the text "Test User"
    When I open the visit "Panel delivered" of "Panel upgrade"
    Then the "Readings" section shows "Panel check"
    When I am on the "Panel upgrade" project page
    Then the readings listed are "Panel check"

    And I have a published reading form "Old check" with the field "Pressure"
    And I filled in the reading "Old check" on the visit "Panel delivered" with "Pressure" as "4.5"
    And the form "Old check" is archived
    When I open the visit "Panel delivered" of "Panel upgrade"
    And I follow the "Add a reading" link
    Then the forms offered are "Panel check"
    When I open the visit "Panel delivered" of "Panel upgrade"
    And I follow the "Old check" link in the "Readings" section
    Then I see the heading "Old check"
    And I see the text "Pressure"
    And I see the text "4.5"

  @wip @task:061

    And I send the same reading form again
    And I am on the "Panel upgrade" project page
