Feature: Uploaded reports
  As someone responsible for a project
  I want to upload the project's reports and find them on the project
  So that the finished report stays with the work it describes (ADR-0008)

  Background:
    Given I am signed in with an existing account
    And I have a customer "Acme Ltd" with status "Active" and tags "retail"
    And "Acme Ltd" has a site "Haifa warehouse"
    And I have a project named "Panel upgrade" at the site "Haifa warehouse"

  @task:064
  Scenario: I upload a report and download it from the project
    When I am on the "Panel upgrade" project page
    And I add the file "inspection-report.pdf" with "Upload a report"
    Then the reports listed are "inspection-report.pdf"
    And the "Reports" section shows "Test User"
    And the "Photos and files" section does not show "inspection-report.pdf"
    And the report "inspection-report.pdf" downloads as "inspection-report.pdf"

  @task:064
  Scenario: A report must be a document, up to 50 MB
    When I am on the "Panel upgrade" project page
    And I add the file "walkthrough.mp4" with "Upload a report"
    Then I see the error "Reports must be PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, text or images"
    When I add a 60 MB file "huge-report.pdf" with "Upload a report"
    Then I see the error "Reports can be up to 50 MB"
    And the "Reports" section shows "No reports yet."

  @task:064
  Scenario: I delete my report, and an admin restores it
    When I am on the "Panel upgrade" project page
    And I add the file "inspection-report.pdf" with "Upload a report"

    Then the "Reports" section shows "No reports yet."

    Then I see the text "Report"
