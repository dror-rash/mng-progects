Feature: The POC flow, from a customer to a report
  As the owner showing the POC
  I want one story to work from start to finish, locally and on the deployed app
  So that a viewer can follow the work from a customer and its site to the report, with each person seeing their part (ADR-0008)

  # One scenario on purpose: each part needs what the part before it made, and every person in it is a new
  # account. Split into several scenarios, each would sign up its people again and repeat the setup through
  # the pages, which the preview's sign-up limit can't afford. The piece-by-piece scenarios live in the
  # features of tasks 053–061 and 064; this one checks that the pieces work together.
  #
  # It runs locally (CI's e2e job) and against the deployed preview (BASE_URL, task 068), so every step goes
  # through the app only: no database or storage access from the test runner. Against a deployment, sign-ups
  # and sign-ins are spaced at least 10 seconds apart: Better Auth allows 3 per 10 seconds per IP, and
  # deployments never turn the limit off (rule 13).
  #
  # People: "I" am the admin (my own new workspace); the worker and the partner user join with invite links.
  @poc @task:069 @wip @timeout:240000
  Scenario: An admin sets up the work, a worker does it on site, the admin adds the report, and a partner sees only their own
    # The admin: a customer with a sub-company, a site with the person to meet there, a project with two tasks
    Given I am signed in with an existing account

    # The admin: a published reading form, and a worker on the project's crew
    And I have a published reading form "Panel check" with the fields:
      | label           | type   | unit | required | options             |
      | Voltage         | Number | V    | yes      |                     |
      | Cable condition | Choice |      | no       | Good, Worn, Damaged |

    # A partner, at the same site: a short check that they see their own project and its site, and nothing
    # of ours (the leak suite, partner-access.feature, checks the details)
